## Introduction 


In this project we are goint to use OSM format maps, because they are open source and have good support. There are multiple different types of ways to format an [OSM map](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_file_formats). We have chosen to use .osm files for formating and as a data source. 
With mapping, its important to have a tool to visualize the documents to cross check that everything is correct. To our knowledge [Qgis](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/) is the most used tool for that, so we are basing our project on qgis, however as OSM is a widespread format if necessary its also possible to you use other tools to process analyse the maps. 


## How to open  a file with .osm extension in qgis
