## Introduction

On this page I will hold tutorials, documentation about general data preprocessing steps for Hong Kong data (Currently PCB data(Private) and [Speed-Panel data](https://data.gov.hk/en-data/dataset/hk-td-tis-speed-map-panels))
There are three categories of documents on this page: Code description files for most important code-pieces; Software design guideline descriptions for current project; Step by step tutorial for going through 
the data preprocessing steps for Hong Kong traffic data. 

## Topics

+ [On this code Documentation page]({{page.url}}code) I keep more thorough descriptions of some important/complex 
code files available at [Github](https://github.com/AndresNamm/) which might help in addition to reading the code.
