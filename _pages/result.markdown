title: Experiment and Result Analysis
permalink: /result/

## Introduction

Here I describe the methodologies used to analyse the incident detection
learning methods from the machine learning perpective.


## Result Analysis

I have described the Experiment and the results in the last chapters (5.2 - 6) of my [dissertation]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/files/detection.pdf). A quick overview of the Area Under
Curve values in Hong Kong roads with different datasets can be seen  on this [post]({{site.baseurl}}/Progress-Report). 

## Methods to be used - TODO

+ SSE  
+ Learning Curves -
+ Pipeline analysis - what part to focus on.
+ Analysing High variance vs Bias
+ Accuracy, Precision, Recall
