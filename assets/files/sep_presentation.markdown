Dear audience, thank you for listening to my presentation. Because this presentation is 5 minutes instead of 10 I will have to skip some slides ive created. Without further ado, I would like to
start

 

1SLIDE

The goal of this research is to apply and develop novel automatic incident detection System and test out a method in Hong Kong using  Probe Car and Speed Panel data.

Accurate incident detection is a goal to pursue  mostly for 2 reasons: Routing and Acknowledging. For routing algorithms, incident detection knowledge gives ground to a better estimate of travel times for different routes. Acknowledgment helps to respond faster to incidents.

 

This thesis falls mainly into 2 parts. 1.

1. Generation of a platform, where data required for detection of incidents is stored in a systematic  and anlysable manner in database with parallel processing capabilities

2. LDA method is going to be tested , improved and analysed for Hong Kong conditions.

 

 

2SLIDE

To elaborate my later points a bit better Ive listed the steps used in incident detection under this project It is very simple.

3SLIDE

The first goal for my thesis is to get a better overview of Data and its Transformation.
This is because 80 % of the project consists of data processing and good/bad results here effect the end result a lot

Main parts here are:

+ Decision points regarding data preprocessing - which method to use(This is a big point, for example my teammate Yanhui is currently working on the mapmatching phase which I hope to use later on in improving the overall detection)
+ Potential mistakes - as the code base is really large, we need some tests. Through analysis and test I have already found 1 mistakse and 1 potential mistaks which could effect the end result of the last projecta lot


4SLIDE 

As mentioned before this is a very large project with lots of data transformations. To get a better overview and basis for deciding further action, Ive decided to create a thoroguh Documentation or Step By Step tutorial for this project which bases itself on the data model. Here I will write down the analytics and test for each part. I will also base my database based on this part. 
As my thesis is part of an ongoing project, for later people to understand my work, this tutorial makes understanding this project much easier and quciker. I have taken special note to be as straigthforward and my wordings as possible to communicate as elaborately as possible.

5SLIDE 

Because of time Im not going to discuss this part further

6SLIDE

Based on Analytics function created I hope to get a direction where to go and some potential improvements with detection result. For example I want to test out how much the amount of data affects the end result. For this I will create a correlation analysis with amount of records in segment and detection accuracy. in segment 

7SLIDE 

Ive done a lot of work with understanding the LDA algorithm but my main goal in this thesis is 

to 

1. write thorough description of the used method 
2. deduce some analysis based on the method
3. add new data under analysis


8SLIDE


+  the math is hairy - spent a lot of time
+ training failure 

9SLIDE 

this is my plan. FInishing the thesis should take around 2 months.
